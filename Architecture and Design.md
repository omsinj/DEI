Reward: Users receive a certificate upon completing the game.
Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (possibly with a framework like React)
Backend: Python (Flask/Django for web server), SQLite/PostgreSQL for database
AI/ML: Basic NLP for generating and evaluating trivia questions
Part Two: Immersive and Interactive Section
Description:

Simulation Videos: Interactive videos simulating real-world scenarios related to DEI.
Gameplay: Users answer questions based on the videos; correct answers lead to rewards and progression.
Difficulty Levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert.
Tech Stack:

Video Integration: HTML5 video player (e.g., Video.js) with JavaScript for interactive elements
Backend: Python for logic handling (Flask/Django), possibly integrating machine learning for personalized question generation

Results Needed
Engagement Metrics: Tracking user progress through the trivia game and simulation section.
Completion Rates: Percentage of users who finish the trivia game and receive certificates.
User Feedback: Gathering feedback on content relevance and platform usability.
Resource Usage: Monitoring which DEI resources are most accessed and shared by users.
Tech Stack Summary
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (possibly React/Vue.js)
