**Project Description:**
This platform aims to educate users on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) through engaging and interactive experiences.

**Project Scope:**
Part 1: Cultural Trivia Game
Users are welcomed with a video narration introducing the cultural journey.
Users choose a category: BOLD, VETS BRG, ASPIRE, Women in Tech, PRIDE, etc.
Each category offers a trivia experience with increasing difficulty through 20 levels.
Users answer multiple-choice questions related to the chosen category.
Users receive a certificate of recognition upon completing the game.

**Part 2: Immersive Video Simulation**
Users select a difficulty level: Beginner, Intermediate, or Expert.
Users watch a simulation video.
Users answer questions based on the video content.
Correct answers on the first attempt grant rewards (points, badges, etc.) and progress to the next video.
Incorrect answers offer the option to rewatch the video or receive hints before retrying the question.

**Part 3: DEI Resources**
A dedicated section provides users with curated resources and links related to DEI topics.
Resources can include articles, videos, websites, and training materials.

**Out of Scope:**
Implementing real-world rewards for completing the platform.
Integrating with external social media platforms.
Developing a user profile system with social features.
Creating original video content for simulations (may require third-party resources).

**Project Architecture:**
The platform will utilize a client-server architecture:

**Client-side:**
Web application built with a Javascript framework (React, Vue.js, etc.) for interactivity.
Video playback functionality.
User interface for displaying questions, answers, and progress.

**Server-side:**
Stores game data (questions, answers, user progress).
Delivers video content.
Generates certificates upon game completion.
Manages user rewards in Part 2 (if applicable).
Hosts the DEI resource database.

**Design:**
Part 1: Cultural Trivia Game
Appealing and user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
Visually distinct themes for each cultural category.
Engaging progress bar to track user's level progression.
Certificate design with user's name and completed category.

**Part 2: Immersive Video Simulation**
High-quality video playback with clear audio.
Questions seamlessly integrated after the video for a smooth flow.
Reward system visually appealing and motivating (points, badges, etc.).
Difficulty levels clearly indicated for user selection.

**Part 3: DEI Resources**
Well-organized and categorized resource list for easy navigation.
Short descriptions or summaries for each resource to inform user selection.
Option to filter resources by topic or category (if applicable).
Results Needed:
User data on game progress, question attempts, and answer choices (for Part 1).
User data on video completion rates, answer accuracy, and time spent (for Part 2).
User engagement metrics for the DEI resource section (clicks, downloads, etc.)
